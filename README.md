3 MW Small Scale Hydro Power project by M/S Continental Intra-Tech Pvt. Ltd.
The proposed project activity with title under UCR “3 MW (2X 1.5 MW) Small Scale Hydro Power project by M/S Continental Intra-Tech Pvt. Ltd.”, is a grid connected Hydro Electric Power project located in Kullu district in the state of Himachal Pradesh (India). The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

Scale of the project activity Small Scale

Project participants M/S Continental Intra-Tech Pvt. Ltd. (Project Owner)

Host Party India

Applied methodologies and 
standardized baselines 
Applied Baseline Methodology:
AMS-I. D: “Grid connected renewable electricity 
generation”, version 18

Standardized Methodology: Not Applicable.

(Renewable/Non-Renewable Sources

The project activity aims to harness kinetic energy of river water (renewable source) to generate 
electricity. The net generated electricity from the project activity is sold to the state electricity board 
i.e., Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB) under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) 
signed between the Project Proponent (PP) and the state electricity board. In pre-project scenario, 
electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the 
operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel-based 
generation sources in the grid. Currently, the NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers of fossil fuelbased power plants. Hence, project activity is displacing the gross electricity generation i.e., 34,751 MWh from the NEWNE grid. The project activity doesn’t involve any GHG emission sources.

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity that incorporates the installation and 
operation of two hydro turbines, having aggregated installed capacity of 3 MW in the district Kullu of 
the state of Himachal Pradesh in India. This project has been promoted by M/S Continental Intra-Tech 
Pvt. Ltd. This project activity is also called as Haripur Nallah Small Hydro Electric Power Project.

The Hydro Electric Turbines were commissioned by the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board
(HPSEB), Government of Himachal Pradesh, India. Unit-I was commissioned on 29/07/2017 and UnitII was commissioned on 05/09/2022. In this crediting period, the generation of Unit-I is taken into consideration.
